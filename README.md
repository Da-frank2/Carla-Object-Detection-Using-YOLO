Carla Object Detection Using YOLO

This repository aims to provide YOLO object detection within carla simulation environment. The YOLOv3 detects objects within the environment e.g car,person,bike,etc. This implementation was tested on ubuntu 18.04. Control the car either using keybord keys(left,right,down and up) or (W,A,S,D).

Requirements

1 Python 3.7

2 Opencv (built with cuda and cudnn) -GPU 1070

3 numpy

Installation

To start the implementation

1 Download CARLA simulator (version 0.9.13) latest version

2 git clone https://github.com/Da-frank2/Carla-Object-Detection-Using-YOLO.git

3 Copy Yolo_object_detection_carla.py into CARLA_0.9.13/PythonAPI/example folder

4 Run ./CarlaUE4.sh

5 Move into CARLA_0.9.13/PythonAPI/example folder and run Yolo_object_detection_carla.py
